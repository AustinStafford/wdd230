        <h3>News</h3>
        <p>
          We all know where unowned animals such as dogs and cats end up most of
          the time, the pound. After a certain amount of time, if an animal is
          not adopted, it is put down, regardless of its health. Because of
          this, there are many animals' lives that are cut short. But what if
          this could change? What if a difference could be made in preventing
          unneccisary loss of animal life? Well, one business has made a
          difference! A local 17 year old boy, who has thought on this problem
          and possible solutions to it, founded "Paws for Life," a business
          dedicated to perserving the lives of animals through training programs
          with first responders. Instead of putting unadopted animals to sleep,
          they instead be inducted into programs where they too can make a
          difference in people's lives. Police departments could take K-9s and
          train them for K-9 units. Firefighter departments could adopt an
          animal to be its mascot. Other animals could be trained to be service
          animals. The possibilities are endless. But one thing is certain.
          Regarless of species, every life has meaning and purpose.

          U.S.A tech is a company built by former military recruites who have
          served in the military and have since retired. After their service,
          this band of brothers came together to build U.S.A. Tech, a company
          that makes and sells military approved tactical gear for both military
          and civilian use. "We want our military personal to be in good hands.
          We want those same hands to educate and train civilians in the case of
          self defense or to be prepared for an unforseen scenario." Ten percent
          of each purchase will go towards the Wounded Warrior Charity, a
          charity focused on the well fare of soldiers wounded in battle and to
          ensure these soldiers receive the help they need to fully recover and
          live normal lives.
