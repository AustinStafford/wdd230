            <p>We all know where unowned animals such as dogs and cats end up most of the time, the pound. 
               After a certain amount of time, if an animal is not adopted, it is put down, regardless of its health.
               Because of this, there are many animals' lives that are cut short. But what if this could change? What if 
               we could make a difference in preventing unneccisary loss of animal life? Well, we can make a difference!
               A local 17 year old boy recently propsed that instead of putting unadopted animals to sleep, they instead be 
               inducted into programs where they too can make a difference in people's lives. Police departments could take 
               K-9s and train them for K-9 units. Firefighter departments could adopt an animal to be its mascot. Other animals
               could be trained to be service animals. The possibilities are endless. But one thing is certain, regarless of species, 
               one thing is certain. Every life has meaning and purpose.

                this past summer. During his high school career, Alexander discovered his
                love for photography. During an interview, he shared his post high school

                During school, I actually shot pictures for the school paper and for students senior 
                pictures. I absolutely love taking for pictures and I don't plan on stopping!"

            <p>On September 9th, Kevin Rank returned home from serving a 2 year tour over seas. 
                This was his 3rd tour while in the Army. Kevin first inlisted soon after the attacks 
                of 9/11. After serving in the Army for 21 years, he plans to retire at the end of this year. 
                During an interview, he had this to say about his experience. "During my time of service, I 
                had my highs and I had my lows. I met a lot of great people over the years. But I also lost good friends too. 
                When you've seen as much as a soldier has seen, it can either make or break you. It can lead you down a dark path. 
                Or you could get up and do something about it. Get help if you need it or help someone who needs help. The point is 
                is that you can either let the bad things that happen affect you and others or you could act for yourself and do something 
                good for a change. As for myself, I choose the latter."
