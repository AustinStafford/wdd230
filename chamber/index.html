          We all know where unowned animals such as dogs and cats end up most of
          the time, the pound. After a certain amount of time, if an animal is
          not adopted, it is put down, regardless of its health. Because of
          this, there are many animals' lives that are cut short. But what if
          this could change? What if we could make a difference in preventing
          unneccisary loss of animal life? Well, we can make a difference! A
          local 17 year old boy recently propsed that instead of putting
          unadopted animals to sleep, they instead be inducted into programs
          where they too can make a difference in people's lives. Police
          departments could take K-9s and train them for K-9 units. Firefighter
          departments could adopt an animal to be its mascot. Other animals
          could be trained to be service animals. The possibilities are endless.
          But one thing is certain, regarless of species, one thing is certain.
          Every life has meaning and purpose.

          RVA Commerce is proud to announce the brand new membership level of NP
          Membership, NP standing for non-profit. This new membership level is
          for non-profit organizations. This membership requires no fee. One of
          the benefits of this membership is that it helps non-profit
          organizations connect with other non-profit organizations over common
          goals. This benefits such organizations as it will help them to not
          only grow, but to build stronger foundations that will ensure their
          existance and the effect they have on the community. These connections
          will help non-profit organizations have greater influence in their
          common quest to help others.

          U.S.A tech is a company built by former military recruites who have
          served in the military and have since retired. After their service,
          this band of brothers came together to build U.S.A. Tech, a company
          that makes and sells military approved tactical gear for both military
          and civilian use. "We want our military personal to be in good hands.
          We want those same hands to educate and train civilians in the case of
          self defense or to be prepared for an unforseen scenario." Ten percent
          of each purchase will go towards the Wounded Warrior Charity, a
          charity focused on the well fare of soldiers wounded in battle and to
          ensure these soldiers receive the help they need to fully recover and
          live normal lives.
